During my last role, we faced significant challenges due to tight deadlines. However, I worked closely with the team to overcome these obstacles and deliver a quality product. We received positive feedback from the client.

I enjoy working on software development projects, particularly using agile methodology. My skills include coding, debugging, and testing, and I am always eager to learn new technologies.

There were some difficulties in meeting deadlines in my previous job. The client feedback was not very encouraging, and we had to make numerous revisions.

In my internship, I focused on developing my data analysis skills. I used Python and SQL extensively to analyze large datasets and generate insights. This experience was invaluable in honing my technical abilities.
